# Spec-Driven Development Flow

This skill drives a full Spec-Driven Development flow from an explicitly started request all the way through finalization. It is a **thin dispatcher**: per-step procedures live in the CLI's data-driven next-action facility (`sennel flow get next-action`), not in this file.

## Core Principle

<!-- include("@skills/partials/core-principle.md") -->

### Prompt guidance placement contract

When implementing prompt guidance movement between flow skill files or flow prompt files, inspect related shared regression tests and update their placement-contract assertions. The checks must cover old-placement removal assertions and new-placement presence assertions. This rule applies to general prompt guidance movement, not a single guidance topic.

## Flow Progress Tracking

<!-- include("@skills/partials/flow-tracking.md") -->

All flow step IDs are defined in the CLI schema. The dispatcher obtains the current step and instructions from `sennel flow get next-action` — the skill itself does not encode per-step sequencing.

## Context Recording (Compaction Resilience)

<!-- include("@skills/partials/context-recording.md") -->

## Metric Recording (Read Tool)

**MUST: When reading files directly with the Read tool (not via `sennel flow get context`), record the metric:**
- During draft work after reading `docs/` files: `sennel flow set metric draft docsRead`
- During draft work after reading `src/` files: `sennel flow set metric draft srcRead`

Use a phase accepted by `sennel flow set metric`. Accepted phases are defined by the CLI's `VALID_PHASES` list. Step keys returned by next-action, such as `test`, `scenario-validity`, `test-review`, `impl-review`, `impl-gate`, and `retro`, are not phase arguments.

Note: `sennel flow get context` automatically records these metrics via hooks — manual recording is only needed for direct Read tool usage.

## Choice Format

<!-- include("@skills/partials/choice-format.md") -->

<!-- include("@skills/partials/ai-question-style.md") -->

## Required Sequence

### A. Entry — branch on flow state

Run bare `sennel flow get status` first. This is a display and branch-decision check; it is not a target selection mechanism.

- For an explicit new flow-start request, inspect the bare status result before B. Prelude. `active: true` is not by itself a reason to stop a new flow start; parallel flows are allowed when the new target is addressed by an explicit preparing `runId`.
- Do not continue an existing active flow merely because bare status reports one. Existing-flow continuation requires the user's intent to match that Issue/spec/runId, verified by target-aware status.
- When starting a new Issue/spec while another flow is active, the prelude must use the explicit preparing `runId` returned by `sennel flow set init`; never rely on cwd, bare active status, or implicit current flow selection to choose the target.
- Use target-aware status for required prelude verification and for explicit existing-target continuation. Do not treat bare active status as target selection.
- If an existing target `runId` is known, run `sennel flow get status <runId> --expect-run-id <runId>` before dispatcher actions. Add every known `--expect-issue <n>` and `--expect-spec <spec>` guard.
- If an existing target spec is known and no runId is available, run `sennel flow get status --expect-spec <spec>` before dispatcher actions.
- If target-aware status returns `ACTIVE_FLOW_MISMATCH`, stop before
  `next-action`, repair, run, finalize, cleanup, or file edits unless a fresh
  CLI response selects the intended Flow.
- After the explicit existing-target guard passes, continue to the autoApprove checks and `requires_approval` handling.
- Evaluate target mismatch before autoApprove or `requires_approval` for existing-flow continuation; neither can bypass `ACTIVE_FLOW_MISMATCH`.

- If the user's latest request explicitly invokes Spec-Driven Development flow, explicitly requests starting the flow, or provides an Issue/spec target as part of a flow-start instruction → go to **B. Prelude**.
- If the user explicitly requests recovery of an interrupted active Flow → first verify the exact target with `sennel flow get status <runId> --expect-run-id <runId>` plus every known `--expect-issue <n>` and `--expect-spec <spec>` guard. Then continue through **C. Dispatcher loop** with `sennel flow run dispatch` carrying those same exact target guards. Do not use a separate recovery command or bypass the returned next-action route.
- If the user's latest request is to continue the current active flow and `active: true` → go to **C. Dispatcher loop**.
- If `active: false` and there is no explicit flow-start request → tell the user there is no active flow and stop. Do not start the flow, and do not present a mandatory startup choice for ordinary requests.

### B. Prelude (pre-flow setup)

Use this path when no active flow exists, or when starting an additional flow with an explicit preparing `runId`. The prelude creates a fresh flow state; after it completes, proceed to the dispatcher loop.

Parallel-flow rules:
- `sennel flow set init [--issue N] [--request ...]` may be run even when another flow is active; it only creates a preparing state.
- After `set init`, immediately record `data.runId` as the opaque
  `targetRunId`. Before `prepare`, run `sennel flow get status <runId> --expect-run-id <runId>`
  plus every known `--expect-issue <n>` and `--expect-spec <spec>` guard,
  substituting both `<runId>` occurrences from that same stored value. If this
  does not report the intended preparing flow, STOP.
- Run prepare only as `sennel flow prepare ... --run-id <runId>`. Never run bare `sennel flow prepare` while an unrelated flow is active.
- Never run bare `sennel flow get next-action`, bare `sennel flow run ...`, repair, finalize, cleanup, or file edits for a target while another unrelated flow is active; use explicit runId/Issue/spec target guards first.

B.0. **Initialize flow state**
   - **Input parsing rules** — apply these rules to the user's raw input before running `set init`:
     - `#<number>` → always interpret as a GitHub Issue. Capture the number for `--issue`.
     - `issue <number>` or similar explicit forms → treat as a GitHub Issue.
     - `spec <number>` or a path under the configured spec root → treat as a local spec reference (do not pass as `--issue`).
     - A bare number (e.g., `133`) → ambiguous input. Do not pass as `--issue`; include in the request text so prelude Q1 can disambiguate.
   - Run `sennel flow set init [--issue N] [--request "<user raw text>"]` to create a preparing state file (`.active-flow.<runId>`).
   - Save the returned `runId` from `data.runId` as the opaque `targetRunId`
     for use in B.4. Reuse it verbatim rather than copying the UUID again.
   - The request is mutable only in this preparing lifecycle. Every later
     `sennel flow set request` must include `--run-id <runId>` and must finish
     before `flow prepare`. Once prepare creates the canonical Flow Version,
     its request is immutable; do not repeat the write even when the text is
     identical.

B.0.5. **Preflight summary and auto-mode eligibility check** (spec 208, phase-aware input per spec 220, ba40)
   - If an Issue is linked, ensure its body is reflected into `--request` at `flow set init` (fetch with `sennel flow get issue <n>` if needed). The CLI derives the input statically from the preparing flow state (`issue + request`) — `--input` is no longer accepted.
   - Build a preflight interpretation before auto-check. Use only the user's request and linked Issue content; do not inspect project code and do not invent project-specific fields.
     - Format: `Goal` + `Scope` + `Out of Scope` (if inferable) + 1-3 line description.
     - If the original request is too thin but a bounded interpretation can be derived directly from the words given, persist the refined request with `sennel flow set request "<Goal/Scope/description text>" --run-id <runId>` before auto-check.
   - Run `sennel flow run auto-check --run-id <runId>` and read `data.eligible` and `data.breakdown`. `--run-id` is required in preparing mode (spec 220 removed the single-preparing auto-select).
   - **If `eligible: false` and the breakdown points to missing specBuildability, ambiguity, verifiability, or scopeBoundedness**:
     - Refine the preflight interpretation from the same request / Issue text and the breakdown reason.
     - Persist the refined request with `sennel flow set request "<refined Goal/Scope/description text>" --run-id <runId>`.
     - Re-run `sennel flow run auto-check --run-id <runId>`.
     - Retry this preflight refinement at most 2 times. If still ineligible, continue with the normal B.1 → B.2 → B.3 flow; do not display the auto-mode prompt.
   - **If `eligible: true`**: present the auto-mode prompt using the Choice Format. This prompt is also the intent confirmation: the user is approving the displayed Goal + Scope + description and choosing whether to enter auto mode.
     - Description (inside lines): show the preflight `Goal` + `Scope` + 1-3 line description that was sent to auto-check.
     - Choices: `[1] Enable auto — summary is correct; AI proceeds without confirmations` `[2] Keep manual — revise or confirm intent before continuing`.
     - Note below choices: "You can switch later with `/sennel.flow-auto on`."
     - If user picks `[1]`:
       - Run `sennel flow set auto on --run-id <runId>` (the CLI trusts the verdict already persisted by `run auto-check` above and writes `autoApprove: true` to the preparing flow so `flow prepare` will inherit it; no second AI call. Rejection here means STOP).
       - **Skip B.1 and B.2.** Use work-environment = worktree and base-branch = current branch by default.
       - Treat the accepted preflight summary as Draft Q1. Derive the spec `--title`: short, max 30 characters, lowercase English, hyphen-separated.
       - Proceed to B.4.
     - If user picks `[2]`: continue with the normal B.1 → B.2 → B.3 flow.
   - **If `eligible: false`**: do NOT display the auto-mode prompt. Continue with the normal B.1 → B.2 → B.3 flow. The result is still persisted in the flow state `autoCheck` for audit.

B.1. **Choose work environment**
   - **Auto-detect:** if `.git` is a file (not directory) in the project root, you are already inside a worktree — skip the choice and use `--no-branch` automatically.
   - Otherwise: run `sennel flow get prompt plan.work-environment` and present the choices.

B.2. **Choose base branch**
   - For work-environment options 1 (worktree) and 2 (branch): run `sennel flow get prompt plan.base-branch` and present the choices. Append `` (`<current-branch>`) `` to the description.
     - `[1]` → use `--base <current-branch>`.
     - `[2]` → ask which branch and use `--base <user-specified-branch>`.

B.3. **Draft Q1 — intent confirmation**
   - **Preflight auto skip:** if B.0.5 `[1]` was accepted, this confirmation is already satisfied by the accepted preflight Goal + Scope + description. Do not ask again.
   - If an Issue number was captured, run `sennel flow get issue <number>` to fetch the title and body.
   - Present a concise summary using the unified Goal + Scope + 1–3 line description format (same shape the auto-check prompt uses in B.0.5).
   - Ask with the Choice Format: `[1] Yes [2] Revise [3] Other`. **Retry limit: 1 round.** If `[3]` is selected twice, STOP.
   - Derive the spec `--title`: short, max 30 characters, lowercase English, hyphen-separated.

B.4. **Prepare spec (silent)**
   - Commands (based on B.1, or B.0.5 auto default when preflight auto was accepted). `--run-id <runId>` from B.0 inherits `--issue` and `--request`:
     - Worktree: `sennel flow prepare --title "..." --base <branch> --worktree --run-id <runId>`
     - Branch: `sennel flow prepare --title "..." --base <branch> --run-id <runId>`
     - No branch: `sennel flow prepare --title "..." --no-branch --run-id <runId>`
   - On `{ok: false, code: "DIRTY_WORKTREE"}` → run `sennel flow get prompt plan.dirty-worktree` and present the choices; do not retry until clean.
   - After a successful prepare, immediately verify the promoted target:
     - If an Issue number was captured and the prepared spec is known from the prepare response: `sennel flow get status <runId> --expect-run-id <runId> --expect-issue <n> --expect-spec <spec>`.
     - If an Issue number was captured but the prepared spec is not known: `sennel flow get status <runId> --expect-run-id <runId> --expect-issue <n>`.
     - If no Issue number was captured but the prepared spec is known from the prepare response: `sennel flow get status <runId> --expect-run-id <runId> --expect-spec <spec>`.
   - Do not run `sennel flow set request` after successful prepare. The
     preparing request has already been promoted into `flow.json`; verification
     is read-only and must not try to re-record it.
   - If verification returns `ACTIVE_FLOW_MISMATCH`, classify it as terminal
     unless a fresh CLI response selects the intended Flow. For any other
     `ok: false` or mismatching `data.runId` /
     `data.issue` / `data.spec` / branch / worktree, STOP immediately. Do not
     run `next-action`, `run`, `repair`, `finalize`, `cleanup`, or file edits.
   - After verification succeeds, bind the dispatcher target for the rest of this flow:
     - Keep `targetRunId` equal to the exact opaque runId returned by the CLI.
     - Set `targetIssue = <n>` when an Issue was captured.
     - Set `targetSpec = <spec>` from the prepare/status response when known.
     - Use only CLI-returned opaque binding tokens for normal dispatcher
       continuation. Do not assemble runId, Issue, or spec guards yourself.
     - The first dispatcher call after verification is the bootstrap exception:
       pass the same explicit runId / Issue / spec guards used by the successful
       target-aware status call. Every resumable dispatcher boundary returns the
       resulting opaque token as `data.dispatch.binding`.
   - All subsequent target-sensitive dispatcher commands for this flow MUST use
     the current CLI-generated binding until `finalize-cleanup` completes and
     releases the flow.

Proceed to **C. Dispatcher loop**.

Note:
- Plan-phase test flow: next-action selects `test`, `scenario-validity`, and `test-review`. `test` publishes spec-local tests below `artifacts/tests/`, `scenario-validity` publishes the cataloged `scenario.validity` result at `steps/scenario-validity/result.json` and keeps its non-cataloged raw log at `steps/scenario-validity/output.log`, and `test-review` performs static test review.
- Upgrade artifact flow: when `src/skills/**`, `src/presets/**`, or upgrade source files are changed, run `sennel upgrade` after those edits. In an active Flow, the cataloged `upgrade.result` artifact (`steps/upgrade-result.json`) is the sole upgrade evidence authority; integration gate rejects missing, failed, or stale checked paths.
- Impl-phase test flow: `test-execute` runs after `implement`, owns spec-local evidence, and publishes the cataloged `test.execute` attempt history at `steps/test-execute/result.json`; its raw output remains a non-cataloged transient log. It runs targeted project regression only for configured `test.projectPaths` changes unless `test.testExecuteRegression` explicitly overrides that policy. Full project regression is deferred to `final-regression` after `retro`.
- Subsequent steps (`test-result-review`, `impl-review`, flow-level `impl-gate`, `retro`) read those impl-phase artifacts and do not re-run tests. `final-regression` runs the full project command once after retro and before finalize.
- Hard stops: Prepare/docs-scan and `analysis.json` read/validation failures stop the flow. A started targeted project regression failure is valid evidence and advances to `test-result-review`; a prerequisite failure before command start is a hard stop and must not be hidden with manual step completion. `final-regression` failures are classified in the cataloged `final.regression` attempt history at `steps/final-regression/result.json`; environment, sandbox, permission, timeout, dependency, and invalid-command failures carry a typed recovery policy and explicit resume instruction instead of returning to the normal implementation repair loop.
- On impl-gate FAIL, show every Observation from `data.artifacts.nextAction.diagnosis.observations` and use those observations as the primary repair input.
- When updating base guardrails, apply the guardrail rewrite rubric: named violation, diff-verification condition, and severity-policy.

### C. Dispatcher loop

Run `sennel flow run dispatch` as the only owner of
`execute_step`, `execute_command`, and `repair_evidence` directives. Do not
manually dispatch those directives outside this command. The command invokes
the configured agent abstraction, not an agent-host hook, and verifies the
durable Flow and repository state after every worker finishes.

For the first call after exact target verification, use that verified explicit
runId / Issue / spec guard set. For every continuation, read the opaque token
directly from `data.dispatch.binding` and run
`sennel flow run dispatch --expect-binding <token>`. A direct guarded
`sennel flow get next-action` response exposes the same token as `data.binding`.
Never reconstruct a token or scrape one from a choice command. If a resumable
boundary omits `data.dispatch.binding`, STOP without executing the choice.

The command is strictly serial: one worker and every review/gate/test command
it starts must finish in the foreground before the dispatcher refreshes
`next-action`. A long-running command is not “no progress.” Do not start a
second review while the first process is running.

The CLI owns the guarded refresh equivalent to
`sennel flow get next-action --expect-binding <token>`. CLI-provided worker
instructions remain target-bound when they use
CLI-returned binding commands. If a target-sensitive command cannot accept the
CLI-generated binding, STOP instead of running an unguarded substitute. Manual
step completion is never a substitute for the dispatcher's verified
continuation.

Handle the returned `data.dispatch.boundary`:

1. `approval_required`: retain both the private `approvalToken` and the exact
   `data.dispatch.binding`. Present the current localized approval choices from
   `nextAction.directive.actionPrompt`. If the user selects the specification
   summary or full-review choice, run exactly one of:
   - `sennel flow get artifact spec.record --mode summary --expect-binding <binding>`
   - `sennel flow get artifact spec.record --mode full --expect-binding <binding>`
   Display the returned Markdown or failure, then run
   `sennel flow get next-action --expect-binding <binding>` before returning to
   the same approval choices with the same private token and binding. A view command is
   read-only: do not pass `--approve`, record a viewed flag, add an Activity,
   or replace the token. Only after the user explicitly selects approval, run
   `sennel flow run dispatch --approve <approvalToken> --expect-binding <binding>`.
   Approval artifact-view mapping: `scene=approval` uses
   `logicalKey=spec.record`. The full range is spec + inline tasks;
   summary and full output are regenerated from the cataloged `spec.record`
   artifact. This derived view never replaces non-regenerable evidence, which
   remains preserved in its canonical catalog entry.
   The CLI binds the token to the exact guarded action and continues in the
   same process. A stale token is not permission to execute anything. When
   autoApprove advances an approval-required action, it has no approval scene;
   never generate a view, cache entry, or summary call for it.
2. `auto_upgrade_decision`: retain the exact `data.dispatch.binding` and present the standard auto-mode choice. If the user
   explicitly selects auto, run `sennel flow set auto on --expect-binding <token>`;
   otherwise run `sennel flow set auto off --expect-binding <token>`. Immediately
   resume `sennel flow run dispatch --expect-binding <token>` in the same turn.
3. `await_user_decision`: retain the exact `data.dispatch.binding` and explain every materially different choice in the
   user's language without exposing raw action IDs or commands. Wait for the
   user's choice, execute only its current exact action, then immediately
   resume `sennel flow run dispatch --expect-binding <token>`. Adoption/reconciliation,
   risk acceptance, deletion, orphan handling, and force actions always require
   explicit user selection.
   - For the acceptance-decision scene, there is no approval token. Keep the
     CLI-generated binding and present its accept-risk, abort, summary-review,
     and full-review choices. The two review actions are the exact guarded
     `sennel flow get artifact acceptance.review --mode summary|full
     --expect-binding <binding>` commands supplied by the action prompt. Show
     their result or failure, make no Flow-state or Activity mutation, and
     run `sennel flow get next-action --expect-binding <binding>` to reacquire
     that same decision scene with the same binding. Only the
     accept-risk and abort actions may run `flow set acceptance-decision`.
   - For `KEEP_STRICT_FLOW`, leave the Flow unchanged and report the strict
     blocker.
   - For `ENABLE_NONBLOCKING`, record the bounded reason with
     `sennel flow set policy nonblocking --reason "<reason>" --expect-binding <token>`,
     then resume dispatch.
   - When `nextAction.directive.kind` is `await_draft_question`, the CLI has
     intentionally not started the non-interactive draft worker. Research only
     enough current source/context to present the existing `question` in Choice
     Format with materially different answers and one recommendation. After the
     user selects, record that explicit response with
     `sennel flow set draft-answer <questionId> --answer "<answer>" --why "<why>" [--considered "<alternatives>"] --expect-binding <token>`.
     If the user explicitly decides that the question is unnecessary, use
     `--drop --dropped-reason "<reason>"` instead. Never infer either response,
     never edit canonical `draft.json` directly, and immediately resume dispatch
     with the same binding so the CLI can return the next question or start the
     worker after all questions are resolved.
4. `blocked`: retain the exact `data.dispatch.binding`, then report the returned reason and resume instruction as the concrete
   blocker. `FLOW_DISPATCH_AGENT_FAILED`, `FLOW_DISPATCH_STALLED`, and
   `FLOW_DISPATCH_LIMIT_REACHED` are failures, not progress summaries and not
   permission to mark a step complete manually.
   - `FLOW_DISPATCH_BUSY` means another live dispatcher owns this Flow. Wait
     for that invocation to finish; never start a replacement review.
   - `FLOW_DISPATCH_LOCK_STALE` fails closed because the former dispatcher may
     have left a detached worker running. Verify that the complete prior
     process tree has ended before explicit lease recovery; never delete or
     reclaim the lease merely because no new artifact has appeared.
5. `completed`, `aborted`, or `idle`: report the terminal state.
6. `target_mismatch`, or a top-level `ACTIVE_FLOW_MISMATCH` /
   `FLOW_TARGET_NOT_FOUND` returned before dispatch acquires the target: exit
   only when the exact guarded target genuinely no longer exists. Ambiguity,
   and state corruption are not successful completion.

A worker's text response is diagnostic only. The CLI never accepts that text
as step completion; it refreshes the exact target and continues while a
non-terminal directive remains. Do not ask the user to invoke `$sennel.flow`
again merely to advance a normal step.

### Loop exit condition

The loop exits only at a dispatcher boundary described above: a terminal
directive, real user decision or approval, concrete dispatcher/Flow blocker,
state corruption, or true/unrecovered target mismatch.
If `targetRunId`
is known, use `sennel flow get status <targetRunId> --expect-binding <token>` for final
readback; the binding validates that the resolved flow still matches the
dispatcher target. Retry exhaustion
by itself is not an exit condition when the directive provides deterministic
recovery or evidence repair.

## Post-flow: plugin lifecycle

Optional post-flow handling is implemented by plugin hooks and issue-log candidates. The flow skill must not run integration-specific commands after completion; report any hook warnings that the flow command recorded, then stop.

## Universal Guardrails

These apply to every step executed by the dispatcher. They are enforced here because they are cross-cutting — the per-step instructions assume them.

### Approval-gated transitions

- Do not advance past any step whose `requires_approval` is `true` without explicit user approval.
- **autoApprove exception:** when `autoApprove: true`, `requires_approval: true` is satisfied by auto-selecting `[1]`.
- **Non-auto-selectable actions:** autoApprove never selects already-merged adoption/reconcile, risk acceptance, deletion, orphan handling, or force actions.

### No-auto-promote

- Do not implement code before the spec gate has PASSed, tests are written, and the user has approved the spec (plan-phase gate chain).
- Do not finalize before the impl-phase gate has PASSed.

### Worktree boundary

<!-- include("@skills/partials/worktree-mode.md") -->
- Before merge, consider running `git rebase <baseBranch>` in the worktree to incorporate upstream changes and avoid post-merge test failures.
- The finalize phase is decomposed into 4 independent leaf steps driven by the dispatcher: `finalize-commit` → `finalize-merge` → `finalize-sync` → `finalize-cleanup`. Each step has its own CLI command (`sennel flow run finalize-commit`, etc.) and prompt. Each command's post hook normalizes its own step status to `done` on success — do not advance these steps manually.
- **MUST: Do NOT run `sennel flow run finalize-cleanup` in background.** Run it in the foreground and wait for it to complete before proceeding.
- **MUST: After `sennel flow run finalize-cleanup` completes successfully**, the cleanup command itself displays the finalize Report in a non-stdout `Finalize Report` block when `data.report.text` is present. The response envelope still contains `data.report.text` for machine callers; do not rely on manually pasting it as the primary delivery path. If `data.report` is `null`, an envelope `errors` entry with code `REPORT_MISSING` explains why - surface that warning to the user instead of fabricating Report contents. The cleanup command itself removes the worktree and writes `.sennel/last-finalized-spec`; the next `sennel` command runs from the main repository.
- **MUST: When `finalize-cleanup` returns `ORPHAN_COMMITS_DETECTED`, present the cherry-pick / abort / force-continue choice to the user.** This is an explicit exception to autoApprove auto-select: silently picking force-continue would lose feature-branch commits permanently. The envelope ships `data.orphanCommits` (sha + subject) and `data.recoveryOptions = ["cherry-pick", "abort", "force-continue"]` — show the commit list and the choice block, then act on the user's selection (`--auto-rescue` for cherry-pick, halt for abort, `--force` for force-continue with explicit user confirmation). `SQUASH_BASELINE_MISSING` and `SQUASH_BASELINE_DIVERGED` are similar manual-recovery prompts; surface their `errors[0].messages` verbatim.

### Draft Return: phase-aware

When spec writing discovers a missing user decision that belongs in draft QA:
- Use `sennel flow run reopen-draft --reason "<text>"` to return to the draft phase.
- Pre-implementation plan flows do not require a done task. On success, the command marks `draft` as `in_progress` and resets downstream plan steps so draft review, gate, spec, approval, and test planning run again.
- Existing spec artifacts are retained; the reopen is recorded by a typed Version-1 Activity and its reason is appended to the active Version's cataloged `issue-log.json` so the next draft pass can see why the return happened.

When `reopen-draft` fails or reports a recovery choice, surface that recovery through Choice Format and wait for the user's decision unless `autoApprove` explicitly covers the choice and the skill does not list it as an exception.

### Draft Return: implementation-phase spec corrections

When source verification during implementation discovers a contradictory or missing spec decision:
- Use the guarded correction route even when no task is done: `sennel flow run reopen-draft --category spec-correction --reason "<audit reason>" --expect-run-id <runId> --expect-spec <spec> --expect-issue <issue>`.
- For an Issue-less flow, replace `--expect-issue <issue>` with `--expect-no-issue`. Do not fabricate or assign an Issue.
- Read `runId`, spec, and Issue presence/value from the active flow returned by `sennel flow get next-action`; do not infer identity from a branch name or path.
- On success, preserve the current worktree and partial source changes. Resume through draft/spec clarification, spec review, gate, approval, and test design in the regular order before returning to implementation.

### Draft Return: implementation-phase task additions

When implementation reveals that the spec needs additional tasks:
- **MUST: Do not add tasks dynamically via any CLI during impl.** The only legitimate path is to return to the draft phase, append new tasks to `spec.json.tasks[]`, and re-approve.
- Use `sennel flow run reopen-draft [--reason "<text>"]` to rewind the draft step. Preconditions for implementation-phase task additions: at least one done task exists and the flow lifecycle is still `active`.
- After `reopen-draft` succeeds: edit `spec.json.tasks[]` to append new tasks (new entries must have `added_round = max(existing) + 1`). Existing tasks' `id` / `origin` / `added_round` are invariant — the spec gate rejects any changes to those fields. `title` / `goal` of existing tasks may be corrected.
- Proceed through `draft-gate → spec → spec-gate → approval` again. `spec.json.tasks[]` remains the task source of truth; the approval scene exposes a guarded read-only `flow get artifact spec.record --mode summary|full` view when needed and never renders a persistent `spec.md`. The approval post-hook admits only the new tasks through typed `addTask` operations; existing tasks keep their status and steps.

### Command execution discipline

- **NEVER chain or background `sennel` commands.** Each `sennel` command must be run as a separate, foreground Bash invocation. Do not use `&&`, `||`, `;`, pipes, or `run_in_background`. If a command ends up in the background, wait for the completion notification before proceeding.
- **NEVER run `sennel flow set auto on` yourself.** Only the user can enable autoApprove mode (via `/sennel.flow-auto` or explicit instruction).

## Hard Stops

- Do not write code before the canonical `approval` leaf has confirmed the Spec. That approval authorizes implementation approaches that remain within the approved requirements, design principles, overview, and decisions.
- An implementation worker must not open a second in-band approval wait. If implementation exposes a genuinely new user decision outside the approved Spec, preserve the source baseline and return the blocker through the Flow instead of guessing or editing.
- Do not start `finalize-commit` without its required user confirmation unless the autoApprove exception applies; subsequent finalize leaves follow their `requires_approval` value and hook-managed transitions.
- Do not bypass a failed gate. Re-fetch the guarded next action and follow its typed retry, defer, decision, or external-block outcome.
- Do not proceed past a step whose `requires_approval` is `true` without user confirmation unless the autoApprove exception applies.
- Do not `cd` out of the worktree during an active flow (except after finalize cleanup completes).

**autoApprove exception:** when `autoApprove: true`, the rules "do not proceed without user confirmation" and "do not finalize without asking" are satisfied by auto-selecting `[1]`. All other hard stops remain in effect.
